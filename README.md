#Improvement Areas
We can make it MVVM with clean architecture by adding some extra layer.
Can add more constant classes/function to get data dynamic and customised like fonts, color etc
UI can be more better like list style, color, font etc.

Right now bottom filter I have added buttons in stackview to update with dynamic height. we can make it static width and height by using scrollview or tableview in place of stackview.
Can customised more search bar
Can add more unit and UI testcases.
Not implemented any loader/Activity indicator (future schope- can be implememented while data fetching).
